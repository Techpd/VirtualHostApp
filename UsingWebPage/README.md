# MyLamp Manager

A simple web-based tool for managing a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server. This tool provides a frontend interface to start, stop, restart services, and manage virtual hosts, allowing for easy management of the LAMP environment.

## Features

- **Start Apache and MySQL Services**: Start both Apache and MySQL services.
- **Stop Apache and MySQL Services**: Stop both Apache and MySQL services.
- **Restart Apache and MySQL Services**: Restart both Apache and MySQL services.
- **Setup Virtual Domains**: Configure virtual domains for Apache and add them to `/etc/hosts`.
- **Check Service Status**: Check the current status of Apache, MySQL, and Monit.
- **Manage Virtual Hosts**: Create and manage virtual hosts for custom domains.

## Prerequisites

- **LAMP Stack**: You must have a LAMP stack installed on your server.
- **Apache2**: The Apache2 web server must be installed.
- **MySQL**: The MySQL database server must be installed.
- **PHP**: PHP and required extensions must be installed.

The tool is designed to be run on a Linux-based server.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Techpd/VirtualHostApp.git
   cd mylamp-manager
   ```

2. **Configure Apache and MySQL**:
   Ensure that Apache, MySQL, and PHP are properly installed and running on your system.

3. **Set up the web server**:
   Copy the contents of this repository to your web server directory (`/var/www/html` or similar):

   ```bash
   sudo cp -r * /var/www/html/
   ```

4. **Set appropriate permissions**:
   Ensure that the web server user (`www-data` on Ubuntu) has sufficient permissions:

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/
   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/
   ```

5. **Install necessary PHP packages**:
   If not already installed, you may need to install `php-curl` and `php-json` to ensure compatibility with certain features.

   ```bash
   sudo apt install php-curl php-json
   ```

6. **Configure sudoers** (Optional):
   If the web server needs to execute commands like `sudo systemctl restart apache2`, you'll need to modify your sudoers file to grant permission to the `www-data` user (or whichever user the web server runs as):

   ```bash
   sudo visudo
   ```

   Add the following line:

   ```bash
   www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart apache2, /usr/bin/systemctl restart mysql
   ```

## Usage

### Frontend Interface

Once the tool is set up and running, open it in your web browser. It provides buttons for managing services, adding virtual hosts, and checking the status of Apache, MySQL, and Monit.

### Actions

1. **Start Apache and MySQL**: Click the **Start Services** button to start both services.
2. **Stop Apache and MySQL**: Click the **Stop Services** button to stop both services.
3. **Restart Apache and MySQL**: Click the **Restart Services** button to restart both services.
4. **Setup Virtual Domain**: Click the **Create Virtual Host** button to set up a new virtual host, specifying the domain and document root.
5. **Check Services Status**: Click the **Check Services Status** button to view the current status of Apache, MySQL, and Monit.

### Error Handling

The tool will return feedback messages for each action, indicating whether the requested operation was successful or not.

## Backend API

The backend is built using PHP and accepts requests from the frontend to execute operations. The following actions are supported:

- `setup_virtual_domain`: Set up a new virtual domain and configure Apache.
- `restart_services`: Restart Apache and MySQL services.
- `stop_services`: Stop Apache and MySQL services.
- `check_services_status`: Check the current status of Apache, MySQL, and Monit.

### Example Request

```json
{
  "action": "restart_services"
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Apache and MySQL have been restarted successfully."
}
```
